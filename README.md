This is a small project, a simple match-3-like puzzle. Move adjacent pieces in order to align 3 or more of the same tipe horizontally or vertically. Score is given the more gems are broken in sequences.
For this game, the player must score a minimum number of points before the time runs out. By doing so, a new level starts, with a higher score goal.

The game was made to be played in a portrait-like aspect ratio. Ratios from 3:4 to 9:18 work nicely.
